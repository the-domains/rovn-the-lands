            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The adventure begins</h1><p>The adventure has started.  All the kids are graduating and we are lucky to work in an industry that allows us to continue to work full-time almost anywhere in the world with good access to phone and internet service. We will be chronicling and sharing our experiences as we have them. Our adventure certainly started with a bit of stress. We took delivery our rig from RVs for Less in Knoxville, TN. On the night before a major winter storm was forecasted to hit Knoxville. The team did everything possible to get us on the road ahead of the storm. We ended having to leave without a couple of unresolved issues - that's a story for another post. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3ab23827d3b87ab22979da28bd0444cd852d6dba.jpg"></article>]]></description>
