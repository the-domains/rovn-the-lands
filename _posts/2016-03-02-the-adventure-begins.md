**The adventure has started**.  All the kids are graduating and we are lucky to work in an industry that allows us to continue to work full-time almost anywhere in the world with good access to phone and internet service. We will be chronicling and sharing our experiences as we have them. Our adventure certainly started with a bit of stress. We took delivery our rig from RVs for Less in Knoxville, TN. On the night before a major winter storm was forecasted to hit Knoxville. The team did everything possible to get us on the road ahead of the storm. We ended having to leave without a couple of unresolved issues - that's a story for another post. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed0cc403-e6ae-4f29-837c-6fa5068f4588.JPG)

Before we tell you about our full-time rig we want to share a bit about our experience prior to committing to full-time RV and working. Geni has camped extensively. In fact we turn to her experience help us whenever we get away from the lights of the big city. I have RV'd in the past - having owned a Gas powered Bounder. I learned a lot about what it takes to keep an RV running and efficient. To really understand how we would cope we did the only thing members of the high tech fraternity could do. We did a beta test.  We purchased a Surveyor Cadet 189 SC. We proved to ourselves that we could spend extended periods of time in an RV.  We got a good long road trip in the Cadet - from Texas to Missouri to Illinois to South Dakota to Colorado and back to Texas.  Plus a few other shorter trips. Enjoy a couple of pictures from those experiences. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fececaf1-f79b-437e-b53a-2d78ff304a67.JPG)
